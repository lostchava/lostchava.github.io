         <p>PhoneGap was Created in 2009 by a company called Nitobi, which later was bought out by Adobe. Adobe would then donate it to Appache Foundation which is where it was renamed Cordova. How can PhoneGap be useful for us as a company to use. Phonegap is one of the framework applications that you can use when you are developing an application. PhoneGap is an open source where you will write your code using HTML CSS and Javascript. PhoneGap will then help the user not only make an application but one that is native application on multiple platforms. This is important as making an App that is usable and user friendly is something that a lot of companies will struggle with. PhoneGap uses standard web APIs and makes our code into a native App. This is key to having our App be a user friendly experience as native Apps are proven to be better. This is supported by strong companies like "YML that produce Apps for Apple and other major corporations. So if our company needs to make an application at a low cost PhoneGap is one of the resources we can use. PhoneGap comes with multiple benefits, It doesn't need any new training to use it saving time and cost. It is a streamline service that allows you to deploy on multiple platforms. This in turn lets you use the extra time to focus on the functionality of your native. It also has multiple integrated systems which include, GPS, LocalStorage, Camera, Barcode Scanner, Social Sharing and Facebook Connect. These are just some of many resources that javatpoint goes over when reviewing the usefulness of PhoneGap. Even though PhoneGap seems to have endless advantages there are some downfalls to this application. First the biggest elephant in the room would have to be that Adobe themselves have stopped the support of the PhoneGap system. According to Adobe this mainly stems from the advancements of PWA's bridging the gap between web and native mobile Apps through capabilities such as offline support and push notifications. Another downside is that certain plugins will be or could be outdated, which could lead to problems with our application functionality. Lastly PhoneGap isn't really made for hardware intensive apps that are made for gaming with all its APIs. Even though PhoneGap was innovative for its time, things around it slowly and eventually passed it up making it fall behind. Overall you can still accomplish the development of our company application but there are some pitfalls that can be very concerning. </p>

        <p>Flutter is one of the most popular up and coming app development frameworks. It was started with Google developing it in 2017. This was two years later than the release of React Native by Facebook. React Native is currently the leader in popularity but this doesn't mean it is better. Flutter and React Native have multiple simialrities and great advantages when it comes to streamline App development. With Flutter we will be using a new language called Dart which is similar to swift. This could cost our company time and money to learn this language. This all depends on if our current employees know swift or javascript. If we know swift the transition to dart would be the best for us. This framework allows us to use dart with conjuction of C++ to produce high performing native Apps. Following udemy and other tech savy blogs, flutter does have an edge over React Natvie when it comes to heavy UI usage. This is becuase Flutter uses high level APIs and UI components called widgets. So if we plan on having a very in depth UI we should go with Flutter. Another great thing that Flutter has is the hot-reload, which makes it easier for us to test and fix our Apps. Using Flutter does have its downsides though. One of these would be that Flutter web is not ready to use and will have performance and size problems. It also has problems with ad support and has audio/video issues. This can impact our overall user experience with our App. This is something to take seriously as recovering from negative reviews could hurt us. We should also see if we are trying to have an App that has ads inside of it. If we intend to have ad revenue from our App we should consider other options.Flutter is up and coming framework that might be exactly what we need in our development of our Application. We should take note of the major needs of our App and compare them to what Flutter and React Native and PhoneGap provide.</p>

        <p>React Native was first developed and used by Facebook but also used by other companies such as: Walmart, Tesla and Instagram. These are all based on the web library that Facebook made called React JS. React Native allows you to build mobile applications that function and look just like a native application. This again is a very important aspect of React Native as having a native application is essential. This will produce more users liking our application and really giving a nice overall polish look to our App. Just like PhoneGap React Native also provides us as a company a streamline and easy process to produce an application. This is done by mainly using the React JS library and Javascript. We can use basic web development knowledge of Javascript and plug it into the React Native. React will then take that code and display it in IOS or Android application platform. This lets us save money on training or hiring new people to learn swift or java. React Native also gives us the ability to see native components like View, Text, and Image that are changed to the IOS or Android native UI. This is an advantage that PhoneGap wasn't really capable of doing as it relied on us developing the UI in HTML and CSS. According to dominant App development companies React Native is meant for the mobile app world by using JSX. It optimizes our Javascript code while compiling it, at the same time the program is very type-safe. These two features help us not make simple mistakes that could easily happen when developing our App. Based on multiple statements from the companies stated before, React Native is in multiple production apps. These set companies will continue to invest and develop React Native source, which is another advantage it has compared to PhoneGap. React Native has a very strong user community, this is because it is very fast, easy to learn and has amazing user experience. Even though React Native has an overall positive review, it still has some downsides to it. First of all we still will need to learn and understand how to use React itself. We will also need to take time to teach our company the differences between React Native and CSS as they're very similar. Overall React Native is a tool that is used by the most powerful companies today, needless to say this is something that we should look into for our company.
