            <p>My name is Andrew Sprague and I am a student at CSM currently studying computer science. I am born and raised in the bay area my whole life and so has the majority of my family.
                I grew up playing lots of sports and that love of sports has carried over into adulthood. You can catch me either watching or going to many sporting events. This is the same 
                for all the music festivals and concerts I go to. I do have a BFA degree where I am able to express my creative side of myself. I love to make art for my friends and family, mainly 
                making logos or designs for their products. The most importnat things in my life are my family and my friends who I trust and love more than anything in this world.

        <p> I am attending this class because I want to learn more about webpage development. I want to be able to make a webpage for myself later in my career to show to future employers. I also
            have read that having the basic knowledge of CSS and HTML can be super useful. I also want to add those skills to my résumé to impress future employers.
